# ytui — Improvement Ideas

## Bug Fixes (High Priority)

### ~~1. `moveTrackInPlaylist` missing `playlistId` filter~~ ✓
**Location:** `src/store/index.ts:217-224`

The two position `UPDATE` statements only filter by `trackId`. If a track appears in multiple playlists, both rows get their positions swapped incorrectly. The queries need a `WHERE playlist_id = ?` clause.

### ~~2. `removeTrackFromPlaylist` non-atomic, uses stale state~~ ✓
**Location:** `src/store/index.ts:188-202`

Deletes all rows for a playlist, then re-inserts from in-memory `playlistTracks`. If the store is stale or re-inserts fail midway, tracks are silently lost. Should use a DB transaction instead, reading source-of-truth from the DB rather than in-memory state.

### ~~3. No delete-from-library~~ ✓
**Location:** `src/tui/components/LibraryView.tsx`

The help screen lists `d` as "Delete / remove" but `LibraryView` has no `d` handler. Pressing `d` in the library silently does nothing.

## Code Cleanup (Medium Priority)

### ~~4. Dead no-op `useEffect`s~~ ✓
- `src/tui/components/SearchView.tsx:87` — `useEffect(() => {}, [downloadQueue])` does nothing
- `src/tui/components/ScrollList.tsx:50` — `useEffect(() => {}, [selectedIndex])` does nothing; the comment "Force re-render" is incorrect as an empty effect does not cause a re-render

Both should be removed.

### ~~5. Misnamed `isAfplayAvailable()`~~ ✓
**Location:** `src/lib/player.ts`

Checks for `ffplay` in PATH but is named after the old `afplay` design. It is not called anywhere in the codebase. Remove or rename it.

### ~~6. `drizzle.config.ts` DB path mismatch~~ ✓
Points to `./data/ytui.db` (project-relative) but the app opens `~/.ytui/ytui.db` at runtime. Not a runtime problem since migrations run from SQL files, but misleading for any `drizzle-kit` introspection workflows.

### ~~7. Dead `db:migrate` script~~ ✓
`package.json` references `src/db/migrate.ts` which does not exist — migration logic is inlined into `openDb()` instead. Remove the script or create the file.

## UX / Feature Improvements

### ~~8. Play queue and auto-advance~~ ✓
`n` currently just stops playback. A proper next-track concept would require a play queue. Tracks from a playlist or search results could be enqueued and auto-advanced on track end — `_onTrackEnd` is already wired in `src/lib/player.ts` for exactly this purpose.

### ~~9. Delete track from library~~ ✓
Add a `d` handler in `LibraryView` that removes the track from the DB and deletes the file from disk. Should also handle cascade cleanup from any playlists it belongs to.

### ~~10. URL paste to download~~ ✓
`enqueueUrl()` already exists in `src/lib/downloader.ts` but there is no UI entry point for it. A "paste a URL" flow in `SearchView` — detecting input that looks like a YouTube URL rather than a search query — would expose this without requiring a new view.

### ~~11. Volume control~~ ✓
`ffplay` supports a `-volume 0–100` flag. Adding `[` / `]` keybindings to adjust volume and persisting the value across track changes would make the player significantly more usable.

### ~~12. Shuffle and repeat modes~~ ✓
Player state could track a mode flag (`normal | shuffle | repeat-one | repeat-all`) toggled with `r` and `s` keybindings — standard music player conventions.

### ~~13. Track metadata in PlayerBar~~ ✓
`PlayerBar` currently shows only the filename. Channel name and full duration are already in the DB and available via the player state; surfacing them in the now-playing bar is a small change with a noticeable UX improvement.

### ~~14. Mark already-downloaded tracks in search results~~ ✓
`SearchView` has no way to know which results are already in the library. A visual indicator (e.g. a `✓` marker) on already-downloaded tracks would prevent redundant downloads and give useful context.

### ~~15. Cross-platform support~~ ✓
The app is effectively macOS-only — `ffplay` is downloaded from `evermeet.cx` (an Intel macOS static binary), and binary resolution only checks Homebrew paths. Linux and Windows support would require platform detection in `src/lib/ffmpeg.ts` and `src/lib/ytdlp.ts`.

---

## Architecture / Technical Debt

### ~~16. Blocking search~~ ✓
`searchYouTube()` in `src/lib/ytdlp.ts` uses `spawnSync`, which blocks the Bun event loop — and the entire TUI — while the search runs. It should be converted to async `Bun.spawn` with a promise, consistent with how `downloadAudio()` is already implemented.

### ~~17. SQL injection in migration runner~~ ✓
**Location:** `src/db/index.ts`

The `INSERT INTO __drizzle_migrations` statement interpolates the migration filename directly into a SQL string. The filename is local and controlled, but it should use a parameterized query for correctness and to establish a safe pattern.

### ~~18. No retry for failed downloads~~ ✓
Jobs stuck in `error` state persist in memory but there is no way to retry them from the UI. A `r` keybind in `DownloadQueue` to re-enqueue errored jobs would cover the common case of a transient network failure.

### ~~19. `ffmpeg` is downloaded but never used~~ ✓
`ensureFfmpeg()` is called at startup but `ffmpeg` is never invoked anywhere in the codebase. It was likely intended for audio format conversion. Either wire it into the download pipeline or remove it from the startup sequence.
